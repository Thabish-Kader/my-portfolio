## Next-JS,Framer motion, Tailwind, Vercel

This is my portfolio website. I have utilized framer-motion and tailwind css extensively in this. I wanted to try out framer motion for some time now but i was putting it off as there was no use case for it up until now. I was quite bored useing tailwinds in built animation but did not want to spend a lot of time in applicaiton which did not require much animation. But then i realized that i havent created a good portfolio yet !!. Now, since i have a good reason to build a beautiful site. I present you with my [portfolio](https://my-portfolio-30apz7oh0-thabish-kader.vercel.app/)  

## Skills Aquired

-   Framer motion
-   Advanced Tailwind CSS Techniques (Side Scroll) 

### Problems Faced
- While building this site i realizwd am not very good with color combination. I tend to always pair black with bright color such as red, green, white etc. After trying a lot of different colors i felt satisfied with VS code black owl theme (very cool in my opinion) 


### Final Taughts
Framer motion is an amazing library after playing with it i just scratched the surface. I plan to learn three js in the future as it integrates well with framer motion.
